# Banking System in C++

This is a simple console-based banking system implemented in C++. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing money, creating Fixed Deposits (FDR), creating Deposit Pension Schemes (DPS), displaying account information, and exiting the system.

## Features
- **Deposit**: Allows users to deposit money into their accounts.
- **Withdraw**: Allows users to withdraw money from their accounts, if they have sufficient balance.
- **Create FDR**: Users can create a Fixed Deposit with a specified amount and duration (months).
- **Create DPS**: Users can create a Deposit Pension Scheme with a specified amount and duration (months).
- **Display Account Info**: Displays the account holder's name, account number, and balance.
- **Exit**: Exits the banking system.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, Visual Studio).
- Windows operating system (due to the usage of Windows-specific libraries like `windows.h` for color output).
- `<conio.h>` library for capturing keyboard input (specific to older compilers and may not be supported in modern compilers or platforms).

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the repository**:
